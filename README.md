### Instructions      
Use the left, right, up and down keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the respective direction. When two tiles with the same number on it touch each other,they combine to form a larger tile with the sum of the two numbers on it. With every valid move, either a '3' or a '6' tile will appear in a random unoccupied position. The aim of the game is to continue combining the tiles till you can reach the 3072 block. The game ends when the entire board is full with no valid moves left.
